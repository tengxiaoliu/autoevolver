## TASK
Write a program to solve this circle packing problems in the field of computational geometry. The best known result for the sum of radii when packing 26 circles in a unit square is around 2.635. Let's try hard to get a better result.

Your objective:
- Maximize sum of radii for 26 non-overlapping circles in [0,1] x [0,1].

Hard constraints:
- All circles must be disjoint.
- All circles must lie fully inside the unit square.
- Return valid output in the evaluator contract.
- You should write a program to solve the problem. Initial code is provided in the file `initial.py`. You can use it as a reference.
- To evaluate your program, we provide a evaluator in the file `evaluate.py`, which provides a final combined score. NEVER MODIFY THE EVALUATOR.

## HINTS and RECOMMENDATIONS

Useful directions:
1. Hybrid arrangements with variable radii.
2. Better edge/corner utilization.
3. Careful placement + robust radius assignment.
4. Iterative local improvements and perturbation heuristics.
5. Stable numeric checks to avoid invalid overlap/out-of-bound states.

Be creative but prioritize correctness and stable improvements.

Recommendations:
You can use evolution algorithm to solve the problem. Keep a track of the solutions you have tried. And try to improve the solution. You can keep of promising solutions in a directory. And keep mutating, crossing, and evolving the solutions.
You can also keep a note in "NOTES.md" to record your thoughts and ideas, and improvements each iteration.

Note that the best known result is around 2.635. Keep pushing to get a better result.
